# Cloudflare Demo Shop

An interactive demo site showcasing the Cloudflare platform across four pillars,
26 solutions in total. Built with **Astro** (static output), deployed on
**Cloudflare Pages**, with **Pages Functions** (Hono on Workers) powering the
interactive demos.

## Local development

```bash
# One-time install
npm install

# Astro dev server — fast HMR, frontend only, no Workers bindings
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321

# Full local stack — Pages Functions included (needs wrangler login)
# If the chat-worker has changed, deploy it first so the CHAT_ROOM binding
# resolves locally as well as in production.
npx wrangler deploy --config chat-worker/wrangler.toml
npm run dev:full     # http://localhost:8788

# One-shot static build
npm run build        # → dist/

# Pages deploy
npm run deploy
```

Use `npm run dev` for iterating on layouts, content, and demo UI — it's much
faster. Use `npm run dev:full` when you're testing API endpoints, R2 uploads,
or anything that requires the real Pages Functions runtime.

---

## Deployment

Connected to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub. Push to `main` triggers an automatic
build (`npm run build`) and deploys `dist/`.

### Durable Objects deploy order

The `/durable-objects` demo is backed by a **standalone Worker** named
`demo-shop-chat`, which hosts the `ChatRoom` Durable Object class. The Pages
project binds to that class via `script_name = "demo-shop-chat"` in
`wrangler.toml`.

If you change `chat-worker/src/index.ts`, you must deploy the chat worker
**before** deploying Pages:

```bash
# 1. Deploy the Worker that owns the ChatRoom DO class
npx wrangler deploy --config chat-worker/wrangler.toml

# 2. Then deploy Pages as normal
npm run deploy
```

Normal content / Astro / Pages Function changes still deploy through the usual
GitHub → Pages flow. Only DO class changes require the extra Worker deploy.

### Environment variables / secrets

Set in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard (Settings → Environment variables) or via
`wrangler pages secret put`:

| Name | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `AIG_TOKEN` | secret | Chatbot, Workers AI demo, AI Gateway demo |
| `CF_ZONE_ID` | plain | CDN cache purge demo |
| `CF_CACHE_PURGE_TOKEN` | secret | CDN cache purge demo (API token with Zone:Cache Purge) |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | secret | Turnstile demo (optional — falls back to CF's test secret) |

Other runtime bindings configured in `wrangler.toml`:

| Name | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `STORAGE_BUCKET` | R2 bucket | R2 upload / download demo |
| `DIAGRAMS_BUCKET` | R2 bucket | Diagram browser |
| `DEMO_KV` | KV namespace | R2 metadata, Page Shield scenarios |
| `AI` | Workers AI binding | Chatbot, Workers AI demo, chat PG moderation |
| `CHAT_ROOM` | DO binding (`script_name = demo-shop-chat`) | Durable Objects chat room demo |

## How the Astro rebuild differs from the previous version

The old site was one big `index.html` plus per-demo HTML files (~300 lines of
duplicated boilerplate each). Two demos were built (WAF, R2); the rest were
stub links to nonexistent pages.

The Astro rebuild replaces this with:

- **One layout** (`SolutionPage.astro`) covering all 26 solution pages
- **One content schema** driving all of them via `.md` files
- **One dynamic route** (`[slug].astro`) generating them all at build
- **One DemoSlot component** that switches between coming-soon / external-link
  / interactive based on frontmatter

Adding a new solution: write a markdown file. Adding interactivity: drop in a
new `.astro` component and register it. No more copy-paste-edit.

The `functions/` directory is still one Hono app handling all `/api/*` routes,
but the Durable Objects demo adds a second script to the repo:

- **Pages Functions** (`functions/api/[[path]].ts`) own the HTTP routes,
  validation, and UI-facing API shape.
- **`chat-worker/`** owns the `ChatRoom` Durable Object class, SQLite storage,
  WebSocket fan-out, and the daily 17:00 UTC reset alarm.

The Pages app talks to the DO through the `CHAT_ROOM` binding. This keeps the
site on Pages while still using a real standalone Durable Object Worker.
